# Dont-Sleep-or-I-Yell

**Inspiration:**
We kept falling asleep in class, twas very bad...

**What it does:**
When our nifty device detects that you have fallen asleep, it YELLS at you. Better wake up!  
**_Pencil Version_**
The pencil version has a button to turn on the device. If it detects that you have fallen asleep, it first starts vibrating as a gentle reminder to wake up. If you still don't wake up, then it starts beeping at you.  
**_Computer Version_** 
The computer version also has a button to turn if on and off. When it detects that you have fallen asleep, first you are shown an alert as a gentle reminder. If you're still in la la land, then it starts beeping at you continuously, the beeps getting faster, until you wake up.

**How we built it:**  
**_Pencil Version_**
We hooked up some Arduino components to a pen.  
**_Computer Version_** 
We used Python to program this. We utilised the libraries *ctypes*, *tkinter*, and *threading* in this app.
